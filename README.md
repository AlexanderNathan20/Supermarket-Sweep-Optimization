🛒 Supermarket Sweep Optimization
This project was developed as part of ISyE 4133: Advanced Optimization (Spring 2024) at Georgia Tech. The objective was to formulate and solve an optimization problem inspired by the game show Supermarket Sweep, in which two shoppers aim to collect the most valuable items in the shortest time possible.

📌 Problem Overview
Given:

56 distinct supermarket items

A single start/end location

A 60-second time constraint for each shopper

A 10-item pickup limit per shopper

The goal is to determine optimal paths for two shoppers to collect the most valuable items without overlap, subject to time and item count constraints.

🔧 Methods
Part A: Shortest Path Calculations
Calculated travel time between all item locations using grid-based movement and Euclidean/Manhattan approximations.

Part B: MIP Formulation (Simultaneous Model)
Mixed Integer Programming model implemented in Gurobi.

Objective: Maximize total item value across both shoppers.

Constraints include:

Time limit (60 seconds)

Max 10 items per shopper

No item duplication

Must return to start

Part C: Optimization Results
Shopper 1: $81.19 collected

Shopper 2: $83.39 collected

Total Value: $164.60

Part D: Visualization
Explored value collected vs. time available.

Logarithmic relationship observed beyond 170 seconds.

Part E: Sequential Model
Shopper 1's path optimized first.

Shopper 2 optimizes with restricted item set.

Total Value: $155.81

📈 Key Insights
The simultaneous model outperforms the sequential model by $8.79.

Value collection increases with time, but with diminishing returns beyond ~180 seconds.

Optimization under constraints mirrors real-world logistics and queuing systems.
